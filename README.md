Tic Tac Toe game: 

Two players can play the game. First player will have 'O' and secone player will have 'X'.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty boxes. The first player to get 3 of boxes marks in a row up, down, across, or diagonally is the winner. If all 9 boxes has been marked and non of the two players get 3 marks in a row up, down, across, or diagonally, this case will be draw.
